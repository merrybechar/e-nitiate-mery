	  <h1>What's HTML?</h1>
	<p class="headers3">HTML  is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.</p>
	  <h3>Tags</h3>
	<p>HTML uses special bits of programming language called "tags" to let the browser know how a webpage should look. The tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag to tell the browser when to start doing something, and an ending tag to tell the browser when to stop doing something. There are many different kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose.</p>
	  <h3>HTML5</h3>
	<p>The W3C is making a new version of HTML, called HTML5, with more features and better support for things like online video. HTML5 is expected to become the standard version of HTML within the next few years.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>head:Defines the Document type</li>
		<li>body:Contains the visible elements of the webpage</li>
		<li style="color: blue">image:Displays an image on the page</li>
	</ul>
	  <h3>Note</h3>
	<p>  Only the content inside the "body" section (the white area above) is displayed in a browser.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag.</li>
			<li>The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name</li>
			<li>HTML tags normally come in pairs.</li>
